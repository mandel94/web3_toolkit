Cryptographic implementations for the web3verse

This is a collection of scripts I am writing while learning web3 development. 

Here you'll find basic implementation of:
  - Merkle Tree;
  - ... TO BE EXTENDED

There is going to be a bit of everything. 

BIG BIG ALERT! This is not production-ready at all!!! For each specific case, I tested only the basic functionalities of each script and data structure. 

All sorts of feedbacks are welcome! :)
